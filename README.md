# Global University Rankings 2023: A Comparative Analysis

## Project Objective: 
In order to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the leading universities in the world, this project aims to collect information on the top-ranked universities in 2023 by utilizing the [QS world university rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023) as the primary data source. This will involve web scraping the ranking data to gather information on various indicators of university performance, such as academic reputation, faculty and research achievements, and student success. The gathered data will be used to gain insights into the current state of higher education and to identify key trends and patterns in the field. Additionally, the resulting data will be provided in an easily accessible format to serve as a valuable resource for students, parents, educators, and researchers to make informed decisions about higher education.
